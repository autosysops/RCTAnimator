## Usage

Download the sourcecode release or the .js files from this repository.
Copy the RctAnimatorManager.js and RctAnimatorRuntime.js file to your OpenRCT2\plugin folder.
To watch animation made in a park you only need the RctAnimatorRuntime.js file. If a menu is created in the plugin it will add a menu item else this won't add a menu item.
The manager is used to create animations and can be found in the menu.
When distributing a park which has animations build in distribute the RctAnimatorRuntime.js with it.
